    <p><b>The</b>history of Uganda <b>comprises</b>history of the people who <u>inhabited</u> the territory of present-day Uganda before the establishment of the Republic of Uganda, and the history of that country once it was established. Evidence from the <i>Paleolithic</i> era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years.

    The forests of Uganda were gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke Central Sudanic languages. The Empire of Kitara grew out of the Urewe culture in the 10th century. Following the migration and invasion of Luo peoples c. 15th century, Kitara would collapse, and from the ashes rose various Biito kingdoms such as Bunyoro alongside Buganda.[citation needed]
